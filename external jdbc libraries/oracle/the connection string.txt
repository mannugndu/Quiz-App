Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");

url: "jadbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE"



**********url is used to represent unique database for your connectivity**********

oracle drivers are categorised in two categiries;
this driver and 
oci driver 
 
we can use the oci (oracle client interface)

thin driver is coded completely in java so we are using this driver here

**********

localhost is representing that oracle is installed into your computer 
in case you have done the networking then you can use the ip address of that computer which is configures with the oracle
so you have to give the ip address of that machiene.


*********************

next you have to give the port number, the port number of oracle is 1521.
***********88
 then specify the edition of the oeacle software
which is XE in this case
